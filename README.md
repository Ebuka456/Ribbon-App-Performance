## ðŸŸ£ Introduction 
Socialblaze launched a new social application called Ribbon. The application, Ribbon was launched on the 6th of July 2023 and the CEO of Socialblaze is in need of an Analyst to help determine the analyze the performance of the Ribbon post launch.

In this project, I would be covering why Product Analytics matters and how it assesses an app's performance after launch. I also determine if the application is a success or not and I also give recommendation for improving the performance of the product and future planning.

## ðŸŸ£ Data Sources

The data source for this project was gotten from [The Numerist July 23' Data Challenge](https://twitter.com/the_numerist/status/1679232841803083776?s=20) which is an online challenge for data analysts in the data space. 

The Data Source can be gotten from [here](https://github.com/Ebuka456/Ribbon-App-Performance/blob/main/Dataset/Copy%20of%20Numerist%20-%20July%2023%20Data%20Challenge.xlsx) and the online community can be found [here](https://discord.com/invite/YwbbzAJStz).

## ðŸŸ£ Data Cleaning
A comprehensive evaluation of the dataset was conducted to identify potential data quality issues and structural anomalies that might necessitate cleaning. However, it is noteworthy that no such issues were detected within the dataset.

The preview of the dataset is seen below

## ðŸŸ£ Exploratory Data Analysis
The aim is to analyze the performance of an app, determine the metrics which can be used to define success of the app launch, spot anomalies or trends in the data set which would be help in offering recommendations to future improvements.

The metrics which was used to define the success of Ribbon was classified into three

1. **User Acquisition Metrics**:
They are vital to assess the app's growth rate and evaluate the overall appeal of the app. High user acquisition is the first step to success, as more users provide a larger audience for engagement and monetization. I also looked into metrics such as the conversion rate, Rate at which the app crashes and uninstalls.

2. **User Engagement Metrics**:
These metrics are essential to assess user satisfaction and interest. High user engagement indicates that users find value in the app, spend more time on it, and are likely to continue using it. It's a key factor in retaining users and building a loyal user base.

3. **Social Activity Metrics**:
These metrics reflect the vitality of the app's social ecosystem. They help gauge the relevance of content, how often users post on the app or engage with posts, and the potential for viral growth. A vibrant social activity within the app can enhance user retention and attract new users through referrals.

The Exploratory Data analysis was well details in my article [here]() and interect with the report [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjg5OTYyNGItMWE5My00YjkzLWFjYTEtNTgzMzJiZWZkNDEzIiwidCI6IjUwZDA2MjZhLTcwN2UtNDk2ZC1iOGU1LTIwYjk1NzA5MTYzZSJ9&pageName=ReportSectionfc8bffaddc1ebb3c1151) 

### But what did I find?

The numbers since the launch has been great. It really shows the tremendous effort put in by Socialblaze in marketing the application. 

In the first two weeks of launch, Ribbon acquired 100 million users and in subsequent weeks has acquired at least 2 million users daily with a overall conversion rate of 99% as at the 5th week post launch. 

Nevertheless, there were daily incidents of app crashes, 49.14K on average daily, and a significant increase in app uninstalls, reaching 28.14K on average daily. I think it's expected that some users will uninstall the app or experience occasional failures, but it's crucial for Social Blaze to work on minimizing these issues. By the fifth week, app uninstalls had risen to 32.3K, and crashes had surged to 57.37K, which is concerning because it suggests that Ribbon is struggling to retain its customers.

Looking at the User Engagement Metrics, the numbers have also been tremendous. With an Average Daily Active User of over 85 million users, a retention rate of 74.4% and the Average time spent on the app on a daily basis of 318.6 mins, Ribbon has done a great job in keeping the users engaged leading to more active users and more time spent on the app. Comparing these number to industry benchmarks to define success, Ribbon's numbers have exceeded the industry benchmarks which means Socialblaze is off to a tremendous start.

From reviewing the social activity of Ribbon, it shows that people are still very active on the app. Sometimes, the activity goes down a bit for a day or two, but then it bounces back up. In simple terms, users are still interested and engaged with the app. It's like a rollercoaster with ups and downs, but the overall excitement and interest are strong, which is a good sign for Ribbon.

## ðŸŸ£ Statistical Analysis
From my exploratory data analysis, I came up with some hypothesis which I needed to verify with my knowledge of statistics. The two bypothesis I came up with are

1. The Daily active users on InstantSnaps has a relationship with the Daily Active users on Ribbon.
2. As the number of ribbon crashes increases, the number of uninstalls increases and the important important metrics reduces.

The hypothesis testing was done using SPSS and the process was documented in details in my [article]()

## ðŸŸ£ Conclusion

Here are my recommedations for the subsequent phases Socialblaze should focus on for advancing the app to a higher stage, enhancing the favorable metrics, and reducing the unfavorable ones.

1. To improve, focus on fixing app crashes and reducing uninstalls. Offer responsive customer support to address user issues promptly. Regularly gather user feedback, monitor performance, and make user-driven enhancements.
2. Regularly update the app with bug fixes, performance boosts, and new features. Notify users about these improvements.
3. Establish a robust testing process for updates and features, covering various devices and systems to catch issues before they reach users.
4. Optimize the app's presence on app stores by regularly updating descriptions, screenshots, and user reviews. Positive reviews and ratings can attract new users and mitigate the impact of uninstalls.
